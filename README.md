Assignment of Getting and cleaning data on coursera

==== Data description====

The variables in the data X are sensor signals measured with waist-mounted smartphone from 30 subjects. The variable in the data Y indicates activity type the subjects performed during recording.

====Code explaination====

The code combined training dataset and test dataset,  and extracted partial variables to create another dataset with the averages of each variable for each activity.

==== New dataset====

The new generated dataset contained variables calculated based on the mean and standard deviation. Each row of the dataset is an average of each activity type for all subjects.

# What is it for ?

It creates a summary of the samsung IoT dataset.

# How to run the script

Copy the folder **UCI HAR Dataset** from this [url](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) in the same repository as the run_analysis.R script.

Run the following command:
´´´bash
Rscript run_analysis.R
´´´
# Input

See available files on the input dataset.
* 'README.txt'
* 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
* 'features.txt': List of all features.
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

* 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
* 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

# Output

Returns a file called **mean\_by_subject\_by_activity.txt** that contains the mean of each physic metrics described in _feature\_info.txt_ by subject and activity.

The output contains the following metrics:
